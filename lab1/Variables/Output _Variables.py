# In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:

# Example
x = "P"
y = "P"
z = "2"
print(x,y,z)

#example 2
x="p"
y="p"
z="2"
print(x+y+z)

# The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:

# Example
x = 32820
y = "PP2"
print(x, y)
