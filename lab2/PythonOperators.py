Python Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
# +	Addition	x + y	
# -	Subtraction	x - y	
# *	Multiplication	x * y	
# /	Division	x / y	
# %	Modulus	x % y	
# **	Exponentiation	x ** y	
# //	Floor division	x // y

Python Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

# ==	Equal	x == y	
# !=	Not equal	x != y	
# >	Greater than	x > y	
# <	Less than	x < y	
# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

Python Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:

# & 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	x & y	
# |	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1	x | y	
# ^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1	x ^ y	
# ~	NOT	Inverts all the bits	~x	
# <<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off	x << 2	
# >>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off	x >> 2

# ()	Parentheses	
# **	Exponentiation	
# +x  -x  ~x	Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT	
# *  /  //  %	Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus	
# +  -	Addition and subtraction	
# <<  >>	Bitwise left and right shifts	
# &	Bitwise AND	
# ^	Bitwise XOR	
# |	Bitwise OR	
# ==  !=  >  >=  <  <=  is  is not  in  not in 	Comparisons, identity, and membership operators	
# not	Logical NOT	
# and	AND	
# or	OR
